This mod is a successor to Simmins mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2266032035]Egg Size Matters[/url] and was requested by Kayedon.

The major difference is that this version changes all eggs based on the body-size of the animal instead of having to add patches for each animal. This should make it compatible with all eggs, vanilla and modded.

All calculations are made with the chicken being the base-animal. So all other eggs will have their Nutrition, Mass and MaxHitPoints changed based on the relative body-size difference between their egg-layer and the vanilla chicken.

There are also mod-settings for setting max/min possible values generated by the mod.

Mod-order should not matter as all changes are done after all definitions have been loaded.
